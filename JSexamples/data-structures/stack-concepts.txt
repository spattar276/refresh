Stacks:
  - Use when we have most recent events to be captured/ string operations/recurrsive function calls/ algebraic operations
  - works LIFO /FILO
  - it is time dependent
  - top is the sentinel variable used to point the block of the data at any point of time
  - peek can retrieve the present size of the stack.
  - push - pushes the element at the top, size of the stack increment by 1 block
  - pop - extract the element from top , size of the stack reduces by 1 block
