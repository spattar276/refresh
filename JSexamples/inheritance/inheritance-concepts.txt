1. What is prototypal chaining?
    - Every function has a prototype property, which contains an object. When this function is invoked using new operator
      an object is created and this has secret link(__proto__) to prototype object.
    - the secret link (__proto__) allows methods and properties of prototype object to be used as if it belongs to a newly created object.

      A
      __proto__
            |
            B
          __proto__
            |
            C
          __proto__
      A contains number of properties, __proto__ is hidden and points to B.
      B __proto__ points to C.
      Chain ends with Object ie highest level parent.

2. What is constructor property ?
    - Is a special property created on the Object.
    - It contains reference to the constructor function used to create the object.
